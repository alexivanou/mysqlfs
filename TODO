* SELECT t0.inode, t0.name, t0.parent,        (SELECT COUNT(inode) FROM tree AS t1 WHERE t1.inode=t0.inode)                AS nlinks FROM tree AS t0 WHERE t0.parent IS NULL

* Implement correct command line parsing to activate big-writes (currently broken)

* Implement new 2.6 API FUSE functions

* Implement more robust connection pool
	- avoid -EMFILE when there are no more free connections

* Implement some security 
	- currently we allow all operations regardless on the privileges.

* Implement path->inode cache and inode->stat cache
	- getattr will greatly benefit from this

* Implement file buffering
	- running query after every write() is insane

* Implement support for xattr and acl
	- FUSE has the methods at least for xattr
