* Implement correct command line parsing to activate big-writes

* Correct query_inode. Current implementation seems very expensive.
	- idea is to have an easy query_inode and a complex query_inode_full
	- query_inode should be a recursive function that walks the path it receives
	- no join to gain maximum speed from mysql query cache

* Implement more robust connection pool
	- avoid -EMFILE when there are no more free connections

* Implement some security 
	- currently we allow all operations regardless on the privileges.

* Implement path->inode cache and inode->stat cache
	- getattr will greatly benefit from this

* Implement file buffering
	- running query after every write() is insane

* Implement support for xattr and acl
	- FUSE has the methods at least for xattr
