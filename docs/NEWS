What is new in 0.4.3
--------------------

* Fixed a compatibility issue with CHOWN operations with FreeBSD.

* Implemented support for table_prefix support. You can now add a prefix
  to mysqlfs tables (Thanks a lot to Szabolcs Palmer for this)

* General improvements to the PHP API

* The SQL updated where somehow a bit broken... sorry for this.

What is new in 0.4.2
--------------------

* Inode size is precalcolated in a replicated environment (should speed
  up things a lot!)

* Database upgrading script - a basic version, but better than nothing,
  isn't? It's in the main dir and it's called update.sh. You can run
  it any time you want and it will only do things that are needed.

* Data_blocks size is now cached in a specific column in order to speed
  up any inode update. Thanks to Armin Wied for the idea!

* Added an index to the tree table to speed up file seeking operations.
  Thanks to Armin Wied for this idea too!

* Included here's a very rough version of a PHP API to interact with
  mysqlfs. Basically now you can fetch datas (or browse the filesystem)
  directly within mysql from PHP. Very cool.

* Improvement to the transaction-safe stuff.


What is new in 0.4.1
--------------------

* Switched DB engine from MyISAM to InnoDB

* Basic Transaction support (with Rollback in case of emergency)

* Upgrade to FUSE API 2.6 - implementing new functions to fully
  support FUSE operations

* Support for "big_writes" to speed up filesystem operations (a lot!)

* Support for FreeBSD (FUSE4BSD) out of the box

* Support for File System statistics (used space, used inodes,
  and some fake-free space and fake-free inodes)

What is new in 0.4.0
--------------------

* Reworked data storage. Instead of one huge record for each
  file we now store the data in 4kB blocks. That greatly 
  improves performance, storage efficiency and overcomes
  problems when storing files larger than 1MB. As a side
  effect it allows storing "sparse" files.
  
What is new in 0.3.1
--------------------

* Added missing schema.sql to the distribution tarball.

What is new in 0.3
------------------

* Complete set of essential operations is now available.

* Fixed most (all?) bugs from previous implementations, 
  especially for write().

* Reworked database schema - now with separate tables
  for directory tree, for inodes and for data.

* Rewritten pooling to avoid "Aieee, we're out of connections!" 
  errors.

* Requires MySQL 5.0.x or higher.

What is new in 0.2
------------------

* Improvement of performance by mysql connection pooling.

* Update atime, mtime.

* Implement chmod().

* Some error processing.

What is new in 0.1
------------------

* Initial release.
