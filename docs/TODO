* Are we sure links work properly?

* Sometime ctime, atime and mtime seem to get messed up. Need to check.

* Deleting a file currently in use will purge all the data blocks
  even if they are currently in use. This could lead to some strange
  situation in the unix world where using a deleted file is a common
  pratice.

* Implement new 2.6 API FUSE functions

* Implement more robust connection pool
	- avoid -EMFILE when there are no more free connections

* Implement some security 
	- currently we allow all operations regardless on the privileges.

* Implement path->inode cache and inode->stat cache
	- getattr will greatly benefit from this

* Implement file buffering
	- running query after every write() is insane

* Implement support for xattr and acl
	- FUSE has the methods at least for xattr
