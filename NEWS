What is new in 0.4.1
--------------------

* Switched DB engine from MyISAM to InnoDB

* Basic Transaction support (with Rollback in case of emergency)

* Upgrade to FUSE API 2.6 - implementing new functions to fully
  support FUSE operations

* Support for "big_writes" to speed up filesystem operations (a lot!)

* Support for FreeBSD (FUSE4BSD) out of the box

* Support for File System statistics (used space, used inodes,
  and some fake-free space and fake-free inodes)

What is new in 0.4.0
--------------------

* Reworked data storage. Instead of one huge record for each
  file we now store the data in 4kB blocks. That greatly 
  improves performance, storage efficiency and overcomes
  problems when storing files larger than 1MB. As a side
  effect it allows storing "sparse" files.
  
What is new in 0.3.1
--------------------

* Added missing schema.sql to the distribution tarball.

What is new in 0.3
------------------

* Complete set of essential operations is now available.

* Fixed most (all?) bugs from previous implementations, 
  especially for write().

* Reworked database schema - now with separate tables
  for directory tree, for inodes and for data.

* Rewritten pooling to avoid "Aieee, we're out of connections!" 
  errors.

* Requires MySQL 5.0.x or higher.

What is new in 0.2
------------------

* Improvement of performance by mysql connection pooling.

* Update atime, mtime.

* Implement chmod().

* Some error processing.
